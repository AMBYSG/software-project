//Explain the datatypes in javascript. What is an undefined value in javascript?//
First part of the question:
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables can hold values of any type without specifying the type explicitly. The data types in JavaScript are categorized into two main groups:

Primitive Data Types:

String: Represents textual data. Example: "Hello, World!"

Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. Example: 42, 3.14

Boolean: Represents a logical entity with two values: true or false.

Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. Example: null

BigInt: Represents integers larger than the range supported by the Number type. Example: 9007199254740991n

Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as object property keys. Example: Symbol('description')

Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:

Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs. Example: { name: "Alice", age: 25 }

Array: Represents an ordered list of values. Example: [1, 2, 3]

Function: Represents a reusable block of code. Example: function add(a, b) { return a + b; }

SECOND PART:
In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It is also the default return value of functions that do not explicitly return anything.

Examples of undefined:
Uninitialized Variable:

javascript
Copy
let x;
console.log(x);
